This code implements the Canny edge detection algorithm, a widely-used technique in image processing to detect edges in images. It reads an image in PGM format and applies several processing steps to identify edges. First, the image is smoothed using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise. Then, the algorithm computes the gradient of the image to identify areas with rapid intensity changes, which are likely to be edges. Non-maximal suppression is applied to thin out the detected edges, followed by a hysteresis process using two thresholds to finalize the edge selection. The user provides three key parameters: sigma (for Gaussian smoothing), tlow, and thigh (which control the hysteresis thresholds). Finally, the processed edge-detected image is saved as a PGM file. The code was authored by Mike Heath and others at the University of South Florida for research purposes, with copyright and usage restrictions.
